# Repository Guidelines

This is an Astro 6 server-rendered app with SolidJS islands, Tailwind CSS v4, Supabase auth, and Cloudflare Workers deployment. Product and stack context lives in @context/foundation/prd.md and @context/foundation/tech-stack.md.

## Critical Rules

- Keep `output: "server"` in @astro.config.mjs; API routes must export `const prerender = false`.
- `src/middleware.ts` resolves the user on every request and stores it in `context.locals.user`. Use that value for protected server-rendered pages instead of client-side auth checks.
- Supabase env values are server-only secrets. Create server clients through `src/lib/supabase.ts`; keep `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` server-only via `astro:env/server`. Add or rename variables in @astro.config.mjs, and keep `.env`, `.dev.vars`, and @.env.example aligned.
- New Supabase tables must enable RLS and define explicit SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE policies for each role that can access the table.
- API routes use uppercase `GET`/`POST` exports, set `prerender = false`, and validate request input with zod.
- Do not write under @context/archive/; archived changes are immutable.
- Do not invent a test command: no test runner or test config exists. For UI/auth changes, run `pnpm run dev` and manually verify the affected route or auth flow; otherwise state why no manual check was needed.

## Communication Language

- Communicate with the user and write project documentation in English unless the user explicitly requests another language.
- Preserve another language only when quoting or editing existing localized content.
- Never infer the preferred language from source-document language, locale, timezone, file names, or repository contents.

## Commands

- Use scripts from @package.json; Node version is fixed in @.nvmrc.
- Before handing off, run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` unless the change only touches docs; report skipped commands.
- CI in @.github/workflows/ci.yml uses `npm ci`, `npx astro sync`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`; account for both lockfiles when changing dependencies.

## Project Shape

- Stack: Astro 6 SSR, SolidJS islands, Tailwind 4, Supabase auth, shadcn/ui components, Cloudflare Workers.
- API endpoints live in `src/pages/api/**` and export `APIRoute` handlers.
- Auth endpoints live in `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`; pages live in `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`; protected page example is `src/pages/dashboard.astro`.
- `src/components/` holds Astro components and Solid `.tsx` islands; shared primitives live in `src/components/ui/`.
- `src/lib/` holds reusable helpers such as `createClient` and `cn`.
- `src/middleware.ts` owns auth population and `PROTECTED_ROUTES`; add protected paths there.
- Shared entities and DTOs go in `src/types.ts`.
- `supabase/` contains local Supabase config; @wrangler.jsonc owns Cloudflare runtime settings.

## Coding Conventions

- Use `@/` imports for `src` paths; `@/*` maps to `./src/*` in @tsconfig.json.
- Use Astro components for static content/layout; use SolidJS only when interactivity is needed.
- Solid components use `PascalCase.tsx`, local interfaces named `Props`, `createSignal` local state, and default exports for page-level islands.
- Move Solid logic shared by 2+ components to `src/components/hooks/use<Name>.ts`; keep page-only signals local.
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional or merged Tailwind classes; do not concatenate class strings manually.
- UI variants follow the existing `cva` pattern in @src/components/ui/button.tsx. Components in `src/components/ui/` follow the shadcn-style "new-york" variant.
- API auth handlers redirect with query-string errors and call `createClient(context.request.headers, context.cookies)`; preserve the null-client path because auth is disabled when Supabase config is missing.
- Put cross-route/domain operations used by 2+ callers in `src/lib/services/<name>.ts`; keep single-use helpers beside the caller.
- Name Supabase migrations `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql` in `supabase/migrations/`.

## Git

- Recent history uses short Conventional Commit prefixes, mainly `chore:` and `docs:`.
- Ensure the GitHub Actions CI gate can pass with required Supabase secrets.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 4 (E2E Tests)

**For E2E tests, use the `/10x-e2e` skill.** It is the single source of truth
for the workflow — risk → seed test + rules → generate → review against the five
anti-patterns → re-prompt → verify. The skill's `references/` carry the full
rules, anti-patterns, seed pattern, and prompt-template.

A few hard rules that hold even before you invoke the skill:

- **Locators:** `getByRole` / `getByLabel` / `getByText` first; `getByTestId`
  only when accessibility attributes are ambiguous. Never CSS selectors, XPath,
  or DOM structure.
- **Never `page.waitForTimeout()`.** Wait for state: `toBeVisible()`,
  `waitForURL()`, `waitForResponse()`.
- **Test independence + cleanup.** Each test runs standalone — its own setup,
  action, assertion, and cleanup; unique ids (timestamp suffix) so parallel runs
  and re-runs don't collide.

Two boundaries to keep straight:

- **DOM (snapshot) is the default.** Vision (`--caps=vision`) is a supplement for
  visual-only risks (layout, z-index, animation); for pixel regression prefer
  deterministic tools (`toMatchSnapshot`, Argos, Lost Pixel). VLM model
  selection/cost is a debugging topic (Lesson 5), not testing.
- **Healer helps on selectors, harms on logic.** A changed selector → healer
  re-finds it (route through PR review). A changed business behavior → healer
  masks the bug; that failing-test-to-fix case is Lesson 5.
