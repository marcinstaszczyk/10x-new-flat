# Repository Guidelines

This is an Astro 6 server-rendered app with SolidJS islands, Tailwind CSS v4, Supabase auth, and Cloudflare Workers deployment. Product and stack context lives in @context/foundation/prd.md and @context/foundation/tech-stack.md.

## Critical Rules

- Keep `output: "server"` in @astro.config.mjs; API routes must export `const prerender = false`.
- `src/middleware.ts` resolves the user on every request and stores it in `context.locals.user`. Use that value for protected server-rendered pages instead of client-side auth checks.
- Supabase env values are server-only secrets. Create server clients through `src/lib/supabase.ts`; keep `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` server-only via `astro:env/server`. Add or rename variables in @astro.config.mjs, and keep `.env`, `.dev.vars`, and @.env.example aligned.
- New Supabase tables must enable RLS and define explicit SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE policies for each role that can access the table.
- API routes use uppercase `GET`/`POST` exports, set `prerender = false`, and validate request input with zod.
- Do not write under @context/archive/; archived changes are immutable.
- Do not invent a test command: no test runner or test config exists. For UI/auth changes, run `pnpm run dev` and manually verify the affected route or auth flow; otherwise state why no manual check was needed.

## Communication Language

- Communicate with the user and write project documentation in English unless the user explicitly requests another language.
- Preserve another language only when quoting or editing existing localized content.
- Never infer the preferred language from source-document language, locale, timezone, file names, or repository contents.

## Commands

- Use scripts from @package.json; Node version is fixed in @.nvmrc.
- Before handing off, run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` unless the change only touches docs; report skipped commands.
- CI in @.github/workflows/ci.yml uses `npm ci`, `npx astro sync`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`; account for both lockfiles when changing dependencies.

## Project Shape

- Stack: Astro 6 SSR, SolidJS islands, Tailwind 4, Supabase auth, shadcn/ui components, Cloudflare Workers.
- API endpoints live in `src/pages/api/**` and export `APIRoute` handlers.
- Auth endpoints live in `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`; pages live in `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`; protected page example is `src/pages/dashboard.astro`.
- `src/components/` holds Astro components and Solid `.tsx` islands; shared primitives live in `src/components/ui/`.
- `src/lib/` holds reusable helpers such as `createClient` and `cn`.
- `src/middleware.ts` owns auth population and `PROTECTED_ROUTES`; add protected paths there.
- Shared entities and DTOs go in `src/types.ts`.
- `supabase/` contains local Supabase config; @wrangler.jsonc owns Cloudflare runtime settings.

## Coding Conventions

- Use `@/` imports for `src` paths; `@/*` maps to `./src/*` in @tsconfig.json.
- Use Astro components for static content/layout; use SolidJS only when interactivity is needed.
- Solid components use `PascalCase.tsx`, local interfaces named `Props`, `createSignal` local state, and default exports for page-level islands.
- Move Solid logic shared by 2+ components to `src/components/hooks/use<Name>.ts`; keep page-only signals local.
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional or merged Tailwind classes; do not concatenate class strings manually.
- UI variants follow the existing `cva` pattern in @src/components/ui/button.tsx. Components in `src/components/ui/` follow the shadcn-style "new-york" variant.
- API auth handlers redirect with query-string errors and call `createClient(context.request.headers, context.cookies)`; preserve the null-client path because auth is disabled when Supabase config is missing.
- Put cross-route/domain operations used by 2+ callers in `src/lib/services/<name>.ts`; keep single-use helpers beside the caller.
- Name Supabase migrations `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql` in `supabase/migrations/`.

## Git

- Recent history uses short Conventional Commit prefixes, mainly `chore:` and `docs:`.
- Ensure the GitHub Actions CI gate can pass with required Supabase secrets.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 1

Open Module 3 by producing a **durable, risk-first quality contract** before any test is written — then drive each rollout phase through the standard change chain.

```
PRD + roadmap + archive
        │
        ▼
   /10x-test-plan  ──►  context/foundation/test-plan.md  (strategy §1–§5 frozen + cookbook §6 grows)
        │
        ▼  (one rollout phase at a time, /clear between handoffs)
   /10x-new ──► /10x-research ──► /10x-plan ──► /10x-implement
```

`/10x-test-plan` is a **stateful orchestrator**, not a one-shot generator. On first run it writes the phased rollout to `context/foundation/test-plan.md`. On every subsequent run it re-derives state from on-disk artifacts and presents the next handoff. The lesson focus is **strategy and rollout sequencing, not configuration**. Hooks, MCP servers, and CI YAML are configured in later lessons of this module.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Quality strategy as a rules-file (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-test-plan` | You have a PRD (and ideally a roadmap and a few archived slices) and you are about to write the project's first tests, or you noticed that AI-generated tests are landing on helpers while critical flows go uncovered. First invocation runs discovery (PRD + roadmap + archive + hot-spot scan), a 5-question user interview, and a synthesis pass with a mandatory challenger check, then writes `test-plan.md` in `context/foundation/` with a risk map (5–7 failure scenarios), a phased rollout table, a stack table, a quality-gates table, a cookbook section (`§6`, fills in as phases ship), and a negative-space section (what we deliberately don't test). Subsequent invocations advance the rollout one handoff at a time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --status` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and you want a compact snapshot of where the rollout stands — which phases are `not started`, `change opened`, `researched`, `planned`, `implementing`, or `complete`, and what the next action is. Does no work; safe to run any time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --refresh` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and one of: a new top-3 risk surfaced from the roadmap or archive, a tool's `checked:` date is older than three months, the project's tech stack changed, or §7 negative-space no longer matches what the team believes. Opens a new `test-plan-refresh-<YYYY-MM-DD>` change folder rather than editing the guide in place. |

### Rollout chain — what happens after the guide is written

The guide's §3 *Phased Rollout* table is the orchestrator's state. For each non-`complete` row the orchestrator selects the next handoff based on which artifacts exist in `context/changes/<change-id>/`:

| State on disk | Next handoff | Status transitions to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| change folder missing | `/10x-new <change-id>` | `change opened` |
| `change.md` only | `/10x-research` (with a risks-to-verify brief) | `researched` |
| `+ research.md` | `/10x-plan` (with cost × signal + cookbook-update constraints) | `planned` |
| `+ plan.md` with pending `## Progress` items | `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <N>` | `implementing` / `complete` |
| `+ plan.md` fully `[x]` | Mark §3 row `complete`; loop to next pending row | — |

Each handoff is a **STOP point**. The orchestrator copies the next command to the clipboard, asks the user to `/clear` and run it, then exits. Re-invoke `/10x-test-plan` (no arguments) to advance.

### Risk-first prioritization rules

- Risks are **failure scenarios in user / business terms**, not test names. "Logged-out user reaches paid content via stale token" is a risk; "test the login form" is not.
- 5 to 7 risks. Fewer is too coarse; more makes prioritization useless.
- Impact and likelihood are user/business ratings, not technical complexity.
- Every risk traces to a source: PRD section, archived slice, roadmap entry, Phase 2 interview question, hot-spot **directory** with churn count, or a tech-stack constraint. No invented risks.
- **Signal, not knowledge.** §2 cites *evidence that raised the risk*, never a file as "where the failure lives." File:line anchors, function names, schema names, and module names are forbidden in §2 — they belong in `/10x-research`'s output, produced per rollout phase against current code. The plan is a QA spec; it is not a code audit.
- Coverage is not the metric. **Risk coverage** is the metric.

### Dual-layer mapping rules

- Classic layer first: the cheapest test that gives a real signal wins. Promote to e2e only when no cheaper layer covers the risk.
- AI-native layer second, and only where it adds signal classic tests do not give cheaply.
- Every AI-native row has a **"When NOT to use"** line. If you cannot write one, drop the row.
- Every tool name carries a `checked: <YYYY-MM-DD>` date. Tool names are examples of the category, not endorsements.
- Both layers must be non-empty in the final guide if the project warrants them. Classic-only is a 2020 plan; AI-native-only is hype. AI-native phases are not mandatory — include them only when the brief justified them under cost × signal.

### Quality gates rules

- Required gates (lint, typecheck, unit+integration, e2e on critical flows) must map to actual CI steps. If a required gate is not yet wired, mark it as `required after §3 Phase <N>` and let the named rollout phase wire it.
- Post-edit hook is **recommended local**, not a CI substitute.
- Multimodal visual review is **selective**, applied to 1–3 critical screens, not to every page.
- Vision-driven fallback (Anthropic Computer Use or OpenAI CUA) is reserved for DOM-unreachable surfaces; expensive per action.

### Cookbook patterns (§6) — fills in over time

`test-plan.md` is both a phased strategy and a **growing cookbook**. §6 starts as placeholders (`TBD — see §3 Phase <N>`) and fills in incrementally — each rollout phase's plan ends with a sub-phase that updates the relevant §6 entry (location, naming, reference test, run command). After Module 3 completes, §6 becomes the canonical answer to "how do I add a test for X in this project?" — and is what `/10x-tdd` reads in Lesson 2.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not write test code. That is Lesson 2 (`/10x-tdd` and unit-test authoring).
- Do not configure hooks, hook lifecycle, or debugging hooks. That is Lesson 3.
- Do not configure MCP servers, Playwright API, e2e code, or multimodal scenario code. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines from scratch or write GitHub Actions YAML. The guide names gates; configuration is owned by Module 1 Lesson 5 and Module 2 Lesson 5.
- Do not benchmark multimodal models. Cite criteria (cost, latency, agent-friendliness), never a ranking.
- Do not read the codebase for knowledge (call graphs, schemas, "which file owns this failure"). That is `/10x-research`'s job, per rollout phase.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — the quality contract produced and maintained by `/10x-test-plan`
- `context/foundation/prd.md` — primary risk source
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` — likelihood weighting
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — stack input (when present)
- `context/archive/<change-id>/plan.md` — implemented risk surface
- `context/changes/<change-id>/` — per-rollout-phase change folder (one per row in §3)
