# Repository Guidelines

This is an Astro 6 server-rendered app with SolidJS islands, Tailwind CSS v4, Supabase auth, and Cloudflare Workers deployment. Product and stack context lives in @context/foundation/prd.md and @context/foundation/tech-stack.md.

## Critical Rules

- Keep `output: "server"` in @astro.config.mjs; API routes must export `const prerender = false`.
- `src/middleware.ts` resolves the user on every request and stores it in `context.locals.user`. Use that value for protected server-rendered pages instead of client-side auth checks.
- Supabase env values are server-only secrets. Create server clients through `src/lib/supabase.ts`; keep `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` server-only via `astro:env/server`. Add or rename variables in @astro.config.mjs, and keep `.env`, `.dev.vars`, and @.env.example aligned.
- New Supabase tables must enable RLS and define explicit SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE policies for each role that can access the table.
- API routes use uppercase `GET`/`POST` exports, set `prerender = false`, and validate request input with zod.
- Do not write under @context/archive/; archived changes are immutable.
- Do not invent a test command: no test runner or test config exists. For UI/auth changes, run `pnpm run dev` and manually verify the affected route or auth flow; otherwise state why no manual check was needed.

## Communication Language

- Communicate with the user and write project documentation in English unless the user explicitly requests another language.
- Preserve another language only when quoting or editing existing localized content.
- Never infer the preferred language from source-document language, locale, timezone, file names, or repository contents.

## Commands

- Use scripts from @package.json; Node version is fixed in @.nvmrc.
- Before handing off, run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` unless the change only touches docs; report skipped commands.
- CI in @.github/workflows/ci.yml uses `npm ci`, `npx astro sync`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`; account for both lockfiles when changing dependencies.

## Project Shape

- Stack: Astro 6 SSR, SolidJS islands, Tailwind 4, Supabase auth, shadcn/ui components, Cloudflare Workers.
- API endpoints live in `src/pages/api/**` and export `APIRoute` handlers.
- Auth endpoints live in `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`; pages live in `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`; protected page example is `src/pages/dashboard.astro`.
- `src/components/` holds Astro components and Solid `.tsx` islands; shared primitives live in `src/components/ui/`.
- `src/lib/` holds reusable helpers such as `createClient` and `cn`.
- `src/middleware.ts` owns auth population and `PROTECTED_ROUTES`; add protected paths there.
- Shared entities and DTOs go in `src/types.ts`.
- `supabase/` contains local Supabase config; @wrangler.jsonc owns Cloudflare runtime settings.

## Coding Conventions

- Use `@/` imports for `src` paths; `@/*` maps to `./src/*` in @tsconfig.json.
- Use Astro components for static content/layout; use SolidJS only when interactivity is needed.
- Solid components use `PascalCase.tsx`, local interfaces named `Props`, `createSignal` local state, and default exports for page-level islands.
- Move Solid logic shared by 2+ components to `src/components/hooks/use<Name>.ts`; keep page-only signals local.
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional or merged Tailwind classes; do not concatenate class strings manually.
- UI variants follow the existing `cva` pattern in @src/components/ui/button.tsx. Components in `src/components/ui/` follow the shadcn-style "new-york" variant.
- API auth handlers redirect with query-string errors and call `createClient(context.request.headers, context.cookies)`; preserve the null-client path because auth is disabled when Supabase config is missing.
- Put cross-route/domain operations used by 2+ callers in `src/lib/services/<name>.ts`; keep single-use helpers beside the caller.
- Name Supabase migrations `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql` in `supabase/migrations/`.

## Git

- Recent history uses short Conventional Commit prefixes, mainly `chore:` and `docs:`.
- Ensure the GitHub Actions CI gate can pass with required Supabase secrets.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 3

Lesson 3 is about **hooks** — turning the quality gates from Lesson 1 and the tests from Lesson 2 into automatic, deterministic checks that fire while the agent works. A hook runs outside the model, so it survives context compression, instruction changes, and the model "forgetting". The payoff for agentic hooks specifically: a `PostToolUse` check can feed its result back into the agent's context, so the agent fixes trivial errors (formatting, a missing import, a wrong type) on its own in the next iteration instead of you discovering them minutes later.

```

        ▼

```

### Task Router — Which layer for this check

| You want to | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| React the instant the agent edits a file | A per-edit hook (`PostToolUse` matcher `Write\|Edit` in your AI coding assistant). Right for fast checks: lint/format, and scoped tests on risk-area files. This is the **only** layer that can hand feedback to the agent mid-session. |
| Run only the tests that depend on the edited file | Parse the path from the hook's stdin (`jq -r .tool_input.file_path`) and run your runner's related-tests mode (`vitest related "$FILE" --run`, `jest --findRelatedTests $FILE`). Gate it on whether the file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`; don't run tests on every helper or config edit. |
| Catch changes that bypassed the agent (manual edits, a teammate's commit) | A pre-commit git hook (Lefthook or Husky+lint-staged) over staged files: lint + typecheck, and tests on staged risk files. |
| Run heavier checks before code leaves the machine | Pre-push: full typecheck or a broader test set. Anything too slow for per-edit moves here. |
| Decide where a given gate belongs | Ask: is it fast enough (a few seconds) for per-edit, or should it wait for commit/push/CI? Slow checks block the agent loop on every edit — push them up a layer. |
| Use the same hook across tools | The trigger → matcher → handler → signal pattern is the same in Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, and Copilot; only the config file and event names change. See the cross-tool table below. |

### Hook lifecycle — the universal pattern

Every tool's hooks follow four steps:

1. **Trigger** — an event in the tool (e.g. the agent just saved a file: `PostToolUse`).
2. **Matcher** — a filter deciding whether this hook runs (tool name like `Write`/`Edit`, file type, or a name pattern).
3. **Handler** — the action that runs, usually a shell command.
4. **Signal** — the result returns to the tool. The exit code says pass/fail; stdout can flow into the agent's context as feedback.

### Exit codes and the feedback loop

- **0** — success; the hook passed, continue.
- **2** — blocking error; the agent sees the feedback and should react.
- **anything else** — non-blocking error; logged, but does not interrupt work.

On a blocking failure, stdout flows into the agent's context (in your AI coding assistant via `additionalContext`, capped at 10,000 characters; other tools have similar mechanisms with their own limits). That is why the agent can self-correct: it sees the concrete message — missing type, unimported module, badly formatted line — not just "something failed".

The boundary: the agent reliably fixes **trivial** corrections on its own. When a test fails because of wrong business logic, the hook surfaces it but the agent may not diagnose the real cause — it says "something is off" and tries a trivial fix. If that does not resolve in one or two tries, the signal comes back to you, and the problem may deserve its own change-id with the full `/10x-new → /10x-research → /10x-plan → /10x-implement` workflow.

### Three local layers (plus CI)

| Layer | Catches | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-edit (agent hooks) | Formatting, simple type errors, failing unit tests on risk files. Only layer that feeds the agent mid-work. | ms–s |
| Pre-commit (git hooks) | What slipped past per-edit: manual edits, files changed outside the hook, checks too slow for per-edit. Operates on staged files. | s |
| Pre-push | Heavier checks before pushing to remote (full typecheck, broader test set). | s–min |
| CI | Integration problems, cross-module dependencies, checks needing infra unavailable locally. | min |

Local layers do **not** replace CI — CI stays the key verification for shared repo state and environments you don't control. But each local layer that catches an error is one fewer CI round-trip. You don't need all layers from day one: start with one per-edit hook (lint) and one commit gate, add layers as you see what escapes. The quality gates in `test-plan.md §4` decide which checks are worth automating and at which layer; a plan may legitimately defer per-edit hooks if the cost/signal ratio isn't there yet.

### Key rules

- Keep per-edit hooks fast. If a check takes more than a few seconds, move it to commit, push, or CI — a slow per-edit hook blocks the agent loop on every edit. Lint/format are ideal per-edit; full typecheck is often a commit gate in larger projects.
- Run scoped tests, not the whole suite, per edit — only tests related to the edited file, and only when that file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`.
- `related` is a subcommand, not a flag (`vitest related`, not `--related`). Use `--run` so the hook terminates instead of entering watch mode.
- `PostToolUse` fires once per tool use; three edits in one turn fire it three times independently — there is no built-in aggregation.
- The git hook tool (Lefthook vs Husky+lint-staged) is an implementation detail; the rule is the same — run checks on staged files before commit. If Husky already works, don't migrate.
- **Context injection is not universal.** Your AI coding assistant, Cursor, Codex, and Copilot (in VS Code) can pass a hook's result to the agent; Windsurf cannot — it can block (exit 2) but can't tell the agent what went wrong.

### The same pattern in every tool

| Tool | Events | Handlers | Context injection | Config |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Your AI coding assistant | ~30 | command, http, mcp_tool, prompt, agent | yes | `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.json` |
| Cursor | ~18 | command, prompt | yes | `.cursor/hooks.json` |
| Codex | 10 | command | yes | `.codex/hooks.json` |
| Windsurf | 12 | command | **no** | `.windsurf/hooks.json` |
| Copilot | ~13 | command, http, prompt | yes (VS Code) | `.github/hooks/*.json` |

### Lesson boundaries

- This lesson configures hooks and local quality layers only. The hook JSON, `lefthook.yml`, and the per-edit/commit/push layering are the scope.
- Do not write E2E tests, configure Playwright/MCP, or run browser scenarios. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test debugging workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not change the risk strategy or quality-gate definitions. That is Lesson 1 (`/10x-test-plan`); read current state with `/10x-test-plan --status`.
- Do not write unit/integration test code from scratch here. That is Lesson 2 — hooks only *run* the tests those lessons produced.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines. That is Module 1 Lesson 5 / Module 2 Lesson 5; hooks are the local layers in front of CI.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.json` — hook configuration (`~/.claude/settings.json` global, `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.json` project, `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.local.json` local overrides). Other tools use their own config file (see the table).
- `lefthook.yml` — pre-commit git hook config (lint + typecheck + tests on `{staged_files}`).
- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — §4 quality gates decide which checks to automate and at which layer; risk areas decide which edits warrant scoped tests.
